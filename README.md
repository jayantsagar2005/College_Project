# 🍽️ Happy Point – Smart Restaurant Discovery Web App

Happy Point is a smart, **location-based restaurant discovery system** that helps users find and interact with their nearest food outlet. The application dynamically fetches the user's real-time location, displays relevant menus, chefs, services, and allows food ordering — all while offering admins a powerful dashboard to manage data in real time.
